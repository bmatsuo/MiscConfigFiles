SYNOPSIS

Contained in here are configs for the following programs:
* vim
* bash

INSTALLING

Simply type
    make install

Or, to install configs for a single program, say vim, just type
    make vim

REVERTING

If you don't like a newly installed configuration file, you can just revert 
to your old configuration. Say you don't like the bash config,
    make bash_revert

If you really want to revert all the programs you can just type
    make revert

If a configuration did not exist for a program prior to it being installed,
it will not be removed. This is an important note. In this case, you must 
remove the configuration yourself.
